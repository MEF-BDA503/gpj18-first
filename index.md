## Project Proposal

We obtained electricty cuts data in Turkey between 2012 and 2018 from the [Energy Transparency Platform](https://seffaflik.epias.com.tr/transparency/index.xhtml). Data contain 74036 rows and 7 variables. Variables are as follows:

```{r}
Santral Ismi: Name of the power plant.
Uzlaştırmaya Esas Veriş Cekiş Birimi (UEVÇB): Registered energy supplier name.
Olay başlangıc tarihi: Start date time of the cut.
Olay bitis tarihi: End date/time of the cut.
İsletmedeki kurulu güc: Total power at the plant.
Olay sırasındaki kapasite: Capacity at the time of incident
Gerekce: Reason of the cut
```

## Learning Objectives
- Cleaning dirty data and doing text mining in order to extract insights.
- Visualizing data according to different variables.
- Visualizing geographical data over the map.

## Analysis Objectives
- Finding longest and shortest cuts and visualizing them.
- Visualizing cuts at the power plants according to city and duration.
- Finding top reasons of electricity cuts with tidy text mining.
- Analyzing cuts vis-a-vis to capacity and total power at the power plant.

Our updated analysis can be found [here](fiRst.html).
