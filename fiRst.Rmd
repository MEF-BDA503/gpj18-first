We obtained electricty cuts data in Turkey between 2012 and 2018 from the Energy Transparency Platform. Data contain 51630 rows and 7 variables.

Objectives of this project is as follows:

# Learning Objectives
* Cleaning dirty data and doing text mining in order to extract insights.
* Visualizing data according to different variables.
* Visualizing geographical data over the map.

# Analysis Objectives
* Finding longest and shortest cuts and visualizing them.
* Visualizing cuts at the power plants according to city and duration.
* Finding top reasons of electricity cuts with tidy text mining.
* Analyzing cuts vis-a-vis to capacity and total power at the power plant.

```{r Getting the Data}
# Create a temporary file
tmp<-tempfile(fileext=".csv")
# Download file from repository to the temp file
download.file("https://github.com/MEF-BDA503/gpj18-first/blob/master/dataset_candidates/ArizaBakim-01012008-01012018.csv?raw=true",destfile=tmp)
```

```{r Initial Cleaning and Analysis}
# Reading data. Encoding as Latin-1 is crucial in order to see Turkish characters properly.
cuts<-read.csv(tmp, encoding= "Latin-1")
# Checking what we have as data.
str(cuts)
# Change type of time and date
cuts$Olay.Baþlangýç.Tarihi <- dmy_hm(cuts$Olay.Baþlangýç.Tarihi)
cuts$Olay.Bitiþ.Tarihi <- dmy_hm(cuts$Olay.Bitiþ.Tarihi)
# Turn power capacity variables into numeric
cuts$Ýþletmedeki.Kurulu.Güç <- gsub(",","",cuts$Ýþletmedeki.Kurulu.Güç)

# Looks like data is until beginning of the 2018 and we have between 10-12K cuts per year between 2014 and 2017.
yearly_cuts <- cuts %>% group_by(year=floor_date(Olay.Baþlangýç.Tarihi,"year")) %>% summarize(Olay.Baþlangýç.Tarihi=n())
yearly_cuts

```{r Plot}
# Let's put the yearly cuts into a bar graph.

```{r New Variables For Calculations}
#Adding süre variable as duration of the cuts as hours and capacity usage ratio at time of cut as capacity usage's ratio to total capacity.

cuts <- cuts %>% mutate(sure = difftime(Olay.Bitiþ.Tarihi,Olay.Baþlangýç.Tarihi,units="hours")) %>% mutate(kapasiteorani = Olay.Sýrasýnda.Kapasite / Ýþletmedeki.Kurulu.Güç)

# Make all strings lower case so that can be cleaned easier.
cuts <- mutate_all(cuts, funs(tolower))
